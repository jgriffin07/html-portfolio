<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I love technology and science. My love for tech and science
  motivated me to learn how to program and it gave me the abtition
  to want to learn. I'm not fond of school but i love to learn on my own terms,
  learning how to program gives myself the ability to learn and to create
  new and existing things.

<p>My top hobbies are to play basketball, play video games, swim, 
  hangout with my girlfriend, and to watch movies.</p>

<p>Fun fact: I completed my first coding program in August 2019</p>
